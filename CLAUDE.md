# Project Guidelines

- Always use Hatch as the project management and build tool.

## Skills & Subagents

### General (shared across projects)
- Skills: .claude/general-skills/
- Subagents: .claude/general-subagents/

### Project-specific
- Skills: .claude/skills/

To invoke a subagent, read its .md file and follow its instructions.
General resources take precedence unless a project-specific skill covers the same topic.
