    "The simulator operates in three phases. First, the **products** phase generates a product catalog with key attributes such as category and price tier. Second, the **product_details** phase enriches each product with detailed content including brand names, titles, descriptions, and feature lists. Third, the **metrics** phase simulates sales transactions with realistic temporal patterns and conversion metrics. You can choose between **rule-based generation**, which is deterministic and interpretable, and **synthesizer-based generation**, which learns patterns from your own data. An **enrichment layer** then allows you to inject known treatment effects—such as a quantity boost or a gradual rollout—so you can validate whether your causal models recover the true effect size."
